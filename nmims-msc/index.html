                                        <p>School of Science was started in 2007 with a view to provide undergraduate and post graduate students an opportunity to be a part of the unique learning methodology of the university, which lays emphasis on academic excellence combined with industry oriented training. With the boom in information technology and more and more sophistication in instrumentation techniques, there is now a very thin dividing line between the various disciplines of science. Therefore, there is a greater need for flexibility in scientific thought as well as training manpower on an interdisciplinary plane. With this thought in view, the SVKM's NMIMS introduced, highly innovative and unique interdisciplinary courses at the School of Science from the academic year 2007-2008.</p>
										<p>The goal of the School of Science is to be a Center of Excellence in the domain of Pure and Applied Science by providing quality education and research.</p>
										<b>History</b>
										<p>The NMIMS Deemed to be University, which began by offering programs in Management, enjoying international recognition as one of the leading institutions of Management training, has now established a School of Technology, a School of Pharmacy, a School of Commerce and a School of Science with a view to provide undergraduate and postgraduate students an opportunity to be a part of the unique learning methodology of the university, which lays emphasis on academic excellence combined with industry oriented training.</p>
										<p>The C. B. Patel Research Centre for Chemistry and Biological Sciences, a prime institution borne out of the foresight of the SVKM and its constant endeavour towards excellence in Science and Technology, has during the last 17 years not only established itself as a leading Research Centre but has also provided training to graduate students for manning posts in the Pharmaceutical industry, in para medical fields and more recently in clinical research organisations.</p>

									<p>Statistics is a rapidly, expanding discipline with openings in practically all industries and service sectors. This is particularly true for the fast growing Insurance sector, which heavily depends on statisticians and actuaries. Unfortunately, the limited availability of seats for the Masters Programme at the Universities level has curtailed academic growth and upward mobility of graduates in Statistics. Moreover, the programmes currently being offered by most Universities lack flexibility and ability to respond to the immediate demands of market forces. This, in general often results in students being qualified but they are not employable. </p>
